# ABSTRACT: 503 Service Unavailable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The server is currently unable to handle the request due to
a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The
implication is that this is a temporary condition which will
be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the
delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no
Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as
it would for a 500 response.

  Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a
  server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish
  to simply refuse the connection.
