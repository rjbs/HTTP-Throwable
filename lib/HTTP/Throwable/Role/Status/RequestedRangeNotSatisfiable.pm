# ABSTRACT: 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a
request included a Range request-header field, and none of the
range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent
of the selected resource, and the request did not include an
If-Range request-header field. (For byte-ranges, this means that
the first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater
than the current length of the selected resource.)

When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the
response SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field specifying
the current length of the selected resource. This response MUST NOT
use the multipart/byteranges content-type.
