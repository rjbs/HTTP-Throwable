# ABSTRACT: an exception that is a redirect

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is an extremely simple method used by most of the 3xx series of
exceptions.  It adds a C<location> attribute that will be provided as the
Location header when the exception is converted to an HTTP message.

Note that "MultipleChoices," the 300 status code is I<not> currently a
redirect, as its Location header is optional.  This may change in the future of
the semantics of this role are refined.
