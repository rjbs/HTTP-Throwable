# ABSTRACT: an exception with a plaintext body

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a very simple role, implementing the required C<as_string>, C<body>,
and C<body_headers> for L<HTTP::Throwable>.  In turn, it requires that a
C<text_body> method be provided.

When an HTTP::Throwable exception uses this role, its PSGI response will have a
C<text/plain> content type and will send the result of calling its C<text_body>
method as the response body.  It will also stringify to the text body.

The role L<HTTP::Throwable::Role::BoringText> can be useful to provide a
C<text_body> method that issues the C<status_line> as the body.
