# ABSTRACT: an exception with no body

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a very simple role, implementing the required C<as_string>, C<body>,
and C<body_headers> for L<HTTP::Throwable>.

When an HTTP::Throwable exception uses this role, its PSGI response will have
no entity body.  It will report a Content-Length of zero.  It will stringify to
its status line.
