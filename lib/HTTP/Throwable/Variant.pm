# ABSTRACT: a package that constructs Moo-based HTTP::Throwables for you

=head1 OVERVIEW

This package is used by L<HTTP::Throwable::Factory> to build
exceptions at runtime.  The exceptions are L<Moo>-based, with
L<MooX::StrictConstructor> applied as well.  It takes two arguments:
C<superclasses>, an arrayref of classes to extend, and C<roles>, an
arrayref of roles to compose.
